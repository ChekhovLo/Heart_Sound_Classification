<br />
>>>>The DT.py file consist of work done regarding Decision tree with oversampling<br />
 <br />
>>>>DTGridSearch.py file has code related to grid search done of decision tree, <br />
best parameters obtained are used in main file i.e DT.py <br />

 <br />
>>>>DTUpSamplingWithDataDuplicaion is file related to manual resampling each minority class<br />
 <br />
>>>>DTUpsamplingCombined.py file is again manual sampling but all  <br />the majority class and all the minority class are resampled here<br />
 <br />
 >>>>InitialCodebase.py file consists of all workdone with algorithms when very less data was available <br />
 <br />
 >>>>KNN.py is main KNN codebase <br />
 <br />
>>>>SignificanceTest.py file is where are the statistical significance test are done on algorithms <br />
 <br />
>>>>anncode.py is file where in all the artificial neural networks work is done in keras over tenseor flow<br />
