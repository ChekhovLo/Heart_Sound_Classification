# Heart_Sound_Classification
**Audio Classification ANN CNN Keras** -This folder shows work done to parse audio files and extract features from them to train different Neural Networks and improve performance by hyper parameter tunning. <br>
**SmartAuscaltationApp** - Developed Android Application which using Stethoscope setup can record, analyze and classify user heart sounds providing preliminary results.   <br>
**Matlab audio filtering and feature extraction** - Audio signal processing works done to denoise the audio file for better prediction and pattern exposure. <br>
**ML Project Initial Implementations** - Initial works done with limited data.
